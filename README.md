# ROMI
Code for ICLR 2026 paper &lt;Model-based Offline RL via Robust Value-Aware Model Learning with Implicitly Differentiable Adaptive Weighting>

The implementation is heavily based on  [OfflineRL-Kit]( https://github.com/yihaosun1124/OfflineRL-Kit.git).

* Prepare your environments as required by OfflineRL-Kit.
* Train and evaluate ROMI by:
```bash
python run_example/run_romi.py
```
